AI is broken. From harmful biases to exploding energy consumption, the current systems create more problems than they solve. Possible Worlds Research is a non-profit initiative dedicated to researching and developing tiny AI models in the area of Natural Language Processing. Why tiny? Because we believe that tomorrow's technology should not pollute our beautiful planet. Because small models can be used by everybody, irrespective of their financial resources. Because doing more with less, in the end, is the true hallmark of 'intelligence'.

# Mission

> Our mission is to build and share AI systems in a responsible, caring and sustainable way.


## Roadmap

We hope to grow our initiative through 2024, starting with the launch of our organisation on GitHub in the first quarter and a preview into some of our open-source code. We will set up a collective in collaboration with a fiscal host in the second quarter, allowing us to be ready to accept donations towards the end of the year. The rest of our efforts will concentrate on growing our community, accepting the first contributions to our source code and setting up an advisory board.

# Possible Worlds Research

Possible Worlds Research is dedicated to researching and developing tiny AI models in the area of Natural Language Processing. Why tiny? Because we believe that tomorrow's technology should not pollute our beautiful planet. Because small models can be used by everybody, irrespective of their financial resources. Because doing more with less, in the end, is the true hallmark of 'intelligence'.
